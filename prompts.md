## Prompt 4: Reality Fracture Website (V0)
**Live Demo:** https://v0-reality-facture-website-8bmc497ee.vercel.app/

> Suppose I want to design a website called Reality Fracture. The background is a deep dark blue. The layout is divided into two sections by a thin, glowing line.
>
> On the upper right side, the word POWER appears in a serif font, colored cyan. It softly fades and glows at regular intervals.
>
> Below it on the right side, the word CONNECTION appears in the same serif font, glowing and fading in red, synchronized with POWER.
>
> Along the central dividing line, slightly lower in the layout, the word STORY appears in white. It continuously rewrites itself and fades in perfect harmony with POWER and CONNECTION.
>
> A glowing "+" icon sits at the intersection of these elements, symbolizing their fusion.

## Prompt 5: Interactive Website Design (V0)
**Live Demo:** https://v0-interactive-website-design-mu.vercel.app/

> The website background is a deep reddish-black, creating a dark and immersive atmosphere.
>
> In the center of the layout, there are small glowing dots placed at regular intervals. These dots are connected by a single curving line that moves like a snake, flowing smoothly through them. This curvy line runs across the entire website, subtly animating in the background and visually linking all sections.
>
> On the right side of the page, there are vertically stacked boxes that move from bottom to top as the user scrolls. These scroll-based animations give the page a dynamic, living feel.
>
> On the left side, there are separate rounded-rectangle boxes labeled Power, Story, and Fracture. On the right side, there are similar rounded-rectangle boxes labeled Connection, Reality, and Upside-Down.
>
> All boxes follow a black-and-red theme and are slightly darker than the background to create depth. The edges of the boxes are softly rounded, and they appear elevated through subtle shadows or glow effects.
>
> The entire website is interactive: scrolling triggers smooth animations, background elements flow continuously, and all motion feels synchronized and intentional, reinforcing the theme of fracture, connection, and reality.

## Prompt 6: Stranger Things Interactive Trailer
**Run:** Open `reality-fracture/index.html` in any browser

> Create a cinematic, auto-playing Stranger Things trailer website that feels less like a webpage and more like uncovering a forgotten VHS tape from Hawkins. The experience opens on a deep black background, quietly breathing with muted dark reds and midnight blues, layered with film grain, scanlines, and a heavy vignette to evoke raw 1980s horror. Typography is deliberate and emotional: Bebas Neue for bold titles, Oswald for grounded body text, and Special Elite for eerie typewriter-style captions. 
>
> The site unfolds through eight short scenes that play automatically, each lingering just long enough to build tension—beginning with a dramatic Netflix intro, flowing into the iconic STRANGER THINGS title reveal, ominous story cards, the chilling memory of the 1983 gate, Vecna's pulsing portal, unsettling radio static, Eleven's confrontation, and finally a restrained yet powerful finale teasing "The Final Gate." 
>
> Motion is slow, intentional, and atmospheric: titles subtly glow and glitch, portals breathe, particles drift upward, and scenes transition with soft scale shifts and lightning-like flashes. The background flickers with faint red and blue energy, as if reality itself is unstable. 
>
> Controls remain minimal but intuitive—navigation dots, soft glass-blur buttons, sound toggle, progress bar, auto-play indicator, keyboard shortcuts, and touch gestures—so the viewer never feels pulled out of the moment. Everything is responsive, scaling naturally for mobile, ensuring the experience remains immersive, unsettling, and cinematic on any screen, like stepping into the Upside Down rather than simply watching it.
