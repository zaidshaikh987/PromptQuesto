Prompt 1 :

There is a red rectangular card. It is divided into three parts. In each of the three parts, there are two boxes: one contains text and the other contains an image, arranged vertically (up and down).

In the first third, there is a text box at the top that reads:
“In the depths of the Upside Down, Vecna prepared to open the final gate.”
Below it, there is a larger image box showing a half mansion under a red sky with blue lightning.

In the second third (the middle section), there is an image at the top and text below it.
The text reads:
“First gate was opened in a scream in 1983.”
Above this text is a larger image consisting of a newspaper collage about a missing boy, including a boyish image of Will from Stranger Things.
At the top of this second compartment, the Stranger Things logo is written.

In the third part, there are again two boxes. The text box is on top, and the image is below it.
The text reads:
“If you hear the voice in static, would you believe it’s a friend or just the wind?”
The image below is larger than the text box and shows a radio with a red heartbeat line.

Generate an image in a rectangular format (4:5 ratio) based on this description.
Maintain a Stranger Things theme, with a red background, clearly visible text, blood splatters, and three compartments as described.
If there is any ambiguity, stick to the Stranger Things visual style and imagery.

OPTIONAL NEGATIVE PROMPT:

cartoon, anime, modern UI, futuristic elements, cyberpunk, blurry text, low resolution, neon colors, childish style




Prompt 2 :

A wide, cinematic Stranger Things–style scene, dark and ominous, set at night.

In the foreground, two teenagers seen from behind, standing on a cracked road, staring upward in fear. Their clothing is 1980s casual, muted blues and reds, slightly dirty and worn.

Behind them on the ground, several motionless bodies lie scattered, partially visible, adding a sense of danger and aftermath.

In the midground, a massive red Upside Down portal, low to the ground, torn open like a burning wound in reality. The portal emits glowing crimson energy, with molten, organic edges, red mist, and sparks.

Emerging from the portal is Vecna, towering and terrifying, skeletal and vine-covered, reaching forward with one hand crackling with blue lightning energy, his body illuminated by red and blue light.

No houses or suburbs are present. Instead, in the background stands the Creel Mansion, partially silhouetted in darkness.
On the right side of the mansion, two windows glow with warm yellow light, standing out against the darkness.

The sky is deep, dark blue, stormy and heavy, with blue lightning bolts tearing through the clouds, subtle but dramatic.

The overall lighting is low-key and moody, with strong contrast between red portal glow and cold blue lightning, creating a classic Stranger Things color palette.

Ultra-detailed, realistic, cinematic Netflix-quality artwork, 1980s supernatural horror aesthetic, ominous, emotional, and intense.

NEGATIVE PROMPT (IMPORTANT):

modern buildings, suburban houses, daylight, cartoon style, anime, futuristic tech, neon cyberpunk, low detail, blurry characters, soft fantasy style
